Hi {name}, I hope this email finds you well. 

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Software Engineering position {job_link if job_link else ''} at {company}. As a recent graduate with a strong foundation in mathematics and computer science, I am eager to contribute to your team's success. 

My experience includes developing and deploying a BERT + LSTM NLP pipeline on enterprise-scale imbalanced data for Databricks during my recent internship and applied machine learning for option pricing using PINNs and LSTMs.
On the software engineering front, I have led the development of full-stack platforms using Spring Boot, MERN, and Django, and built production-ready systems with technologies like Kafka, Redis, Docker, and Firebase. I am also thorough with Core Programming and Data Structures and Algorithms.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can add value to {company}. Please feel free to reach out if you require any additional information. 

P.S. Iâ€™ve linked my resume [Link] for your reference. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
